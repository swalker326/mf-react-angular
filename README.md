# React (rspack) and Angular module federation example

in this example I demo a react host application, with an angular and react remote application sharing state between all 3.


## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Get Started

Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Build the app for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
